## Abstract

This ARC proposes a standard for achieving xGov status. xGov status grants the right to vote on proposals raised by the community, specifically spending a previously specified amount of Algo.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

### What is an xGov?

xGovs, or Expert Governors, are a self-selected group of decentralized decision makers who demonstrate an enduring commitment to the Algorand ecosystem, and whose interests are aligned with the good of the Algorand blockchain. These individuals have the ability to participate in the designation and approval of proposals.

### xGov Committee

xGov Committees are responsible for voting on proposals.

xGov Committee selection and the assignment of their voting power is performed by the Algorand Foundation, based on the selection criteria defined by this ARC.

The current xGov Committee is assigned to Proposals upon finalization.

An xGov Committee is characterized by the following parameters:

- xGov onboarding inception period *I (uint64)*
- xGov Registry creation block *Bc (uint64)*
- Committee period start *Bi (uint64)* — MUST be 0 mod 1 000 000 and *Bi ≥ Bc + I*
- Committee period end *Bf (uint64)* — MUST be 0 mod 1 000 000 and *Bf > Bi*
- Selected xGovs list with their *addresses (bytes[32])* and *votes (uint64)*
- *Total committee members (uint64)* — MUST equal the length of the xGovs list
- *Total committee votes (uint64)* — MUST equal the sum of votes in the xGovs list

### Committee Selection Algorithm

To determine the xGov Committee for a given voting period:

1. Define:
   - `I`: onboarding inception period (in blocks)
   - `Bc`: block where xGov Registry is created
   - `Bi`: committee period start, MUST satisfy `Bi ≥ Bc + I` and `Bi = 0 mod 1_000_000`
   - `Bf`: committee period end, MUST satisfy `Bf > Bi` and `Bf = 0 mod 1_000_000`

2. Collect all block proposers in `[Bi, Bf]` → Potential Committee

3. Extract xGov Subscriptions and xGov Unsubscriptions app calls to the Registry in `[Bc + I, Bf]`
   - Compute `hands_up_list` and `hands_down_list`
   - Derive xGov List as the delta between the two at `Bf`

4. Filter `potential_committee` ∩ `xgov_list` → final `committee`

The Algorand Foundation commits to publishing the committee hash and associated metadata within a safe operational margin `S` blocks after `Bf`.

### Requirement to become an xGov

An xGov **MUST** have an Algorand address

The xGov Committee selection is based on a "backward accountability"
A snapshot of past block proposers is taken, every *Br* blocks to select the xGov Commiittee.

Any Block Proposer in the past *[Bi; Bf]* block range could be selected as a member of the xGov Committee. (with the exclusion of the Algorand Foundation).

Block Proposer **MUST** have been register before the Final blocks of a snapshot to be eligible as xGov Committee members.

### Voting Power

The Voting Power of each xGov Commmittee is calculated independently.

1. Block proposers of past *Br* block are listed, couting 1 vote per proposed block (*Br* = *Vb*).
2. Votes associated with blocks proposed by the Algorand Foundation (*Va*) are deducted
3. The voting power of the xGov Committee is *V* = *Vb* - *Va*

### Representation

The xGov Committee selection **MUST** result in a JSON with following schema:

```json
{
  "title": "xGov Committee",
  "description": "Selected xGov Committee with voting power and validity",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "xGovs": {
      "description": "xGovs with voting power, sorted lexicographically with respect to addresses",
      "type": "array",
      "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "address": {
            "description": "xGov address used on xGov Registry",
            "type": "string"
          },
          "votes": {
            "description": "xGov voting power",
            "type": "number"
          }
        },
        "required": ["address", "votes"]
      },
      "uniqueItems": true
    },
    "inceptionPeriod": {
      "description": "Number of blocks after the xGov Registry creation block, reserved to the first xGov onboarding",
      "type": "number"
    },
    "registryCreation": {
      "description": "The xGov Registry creation block",
      "type": "number"
    },
    "periodStart": {
      "description": "First block of the Committee selection period, must ≡ 0 mod 1,000,000 and greater than registryCreation + inceptionPeriod",
      "type": "number"
    },
    "periodEnd": {
      "description": "Last block of the Committee selection period, must ≡ 0 mod 1,000,000 and greater than periodStart",
      "type": "number"
    },
    "members": {
      "description": "Total number of Committee members",
      "type": "number"
    },
    "votes": {
      "description": "Total number of Committee votes",
      "type": "number"
    }
  },
  "required": ["xGovs", "periodStart", "periodEnd", "members", "votes"],
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

The xGovs arrays **MUST** be sorted in lexicographical order with respect to address keys. 
An xGov Committee is identified by the following ID:

`SHA-512/256(arc0086||SHA-512/256(xGov Committee JSON))`

### Trust Model

The Algorand Foundation is responsible for executing the Committee selection algorithm described above. The correctness of the process is auditable post-facto via:

- The block proposers’ history (on-chain)
- The App call logs to the xGov Registry (on-chain)
- The published Committee JSON (hash verifiable)

Any actor can recompute and verify the selected committee independently from on-chain data.

## Rationale

The previous xGov process see [ARC-33](./arc-0033.md) & [ARC-34](./arc-0034.md) has shown some risk of gamification of the voting system, lack of flexibility.
A flexible community funding mechanism should be available.
Given the shift of the Algorand protocol towards consensus incentivization, the xGov process could be an additional way to push consensus participation.

## Security Considerations

No funds need to leave the user's wallet in order to become an xGov.
