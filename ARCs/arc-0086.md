## Abstract

This ARC proposes a standard for achieving xGov status. xGov status grants the right to vote on proposals raised by the community, specifically spending a previously specified amount of Algo.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

### What is an xGov?

xGovs, or Expert Governors, are a self-selected group of decentralized decision makers who demonstrate an enduring commitment to the Algorand ecosystem, and whose interests are aligned with the good of the Algorand blockchain. These individuals have the ability to participate in the designation and approval of proposals.

### xGov Committee

xGov Committees are responsible for voting on proposals.

xGov Committee selection and the assignment of their voting power is performed by the Algorand Foundation, based on the selection criteria defined by this ARC.

The current xGov Committee is assigned to Proposals upon finalization.

#### xGov Committee Manager

The xGov Committee Manager is an Algorand Address controlled by the Algorand Foundation, it declares the xGov committee currently in charge.

#### xGov Registry

The xGov Registry:

- is an Application deployed by the original [xGov Committee Manager](./arc-0086.md#xgov-committee-manager).
- controls the xGov Treasury Address
- creates Proposal Application
- verifies the result of the Proposal's voting

#### xGov Box

An xGov is represented on-chain with a Box on the [xGov Registry](./arc-0086.md#xgov-registry)

xGov **MUST** provide a Voting Address, stored in the xGov Box.
It is **RECOMMENDED** to provide a Voting different from the xGov Address, to facilitate voting operation on behlaf of the xGov Account.
The Voting Address May be updated by the xGov Address and the current Voting Address.

### Requirement to become an xGov

An xGov **MUST** have an Algorand address
The xGov Committee selection is based on a "backward accountability"
A snapshot of past block proposers is taken, every *Br* blocks to select the xGov Commiittee.

Any Block proposer in the past *Br* block range coubld be selected as a member of the xGov Committee (with the exclusion of the Algorand Foundation).

Block Proposer **MUST** have an [xGov Box](./arc-0086.md#xgov-box) to be eligible as xGov Committee members.

### Voting Power

The Voting Power of each xGov Commmittee is calculated independently.

1. Block proposers of past *Br* block are listed, couting 1 vote per proposed block (*Br* = *Vb*).
2. Votes associated with blocks proposed by the Algorand Foundation (*Va*) are deducted
3. The voting power of the xGov Committee is *V* = *Vb* - *Va*

## Rationale

The previous xGov process see [ARC-33](./arc-0033.md) & [ARC-34](./arc-0034.md) has shown some risk of gamification of the voting system, lack of flexibility.
A flexible community funding mechanism should be available.
Given the shift of the Algorand protocol towards consensus incentivization, the xGov process could be an additional way to push consensus participation.

## Security Considerations

No funds need to leave the user's wallet in order to become an xGov.
