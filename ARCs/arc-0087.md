## Abstract

Adopt a standard key name specification for complex data. 

This defines key names that can be used to represent JSON,
Blobs, or other structures that do not fit neatly into the state

## Motivation

This pattern has emerged over time as a way to circumvent constraints with state storage.
This seeks to codify the practice into a shared definition which can be leveraged as a primitive in the ecosystem.

This greatly simplifies the cross-cutting concerns
when integrating with complex structures by directly addressing values on-chain.


## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

> All bullet points are in reference to Key Names

- **SHOULD** be prefixed with `o_` (for discovery/indexing)
- **MUST** separate nested object keys with `.` 
- **MUST** index collections with `[N]`

## Rationale

Multiple variants of this pattern create downstream cycles which could be avoided.

### JSON/Objects

Given the following object:

```json
{
  "alice": "APZK5I5UAURBDSGFBEHYK3B235CDGYGXG6BAGC34ZHGDPQOJTBM5OSG6IE",
  "bob": "BX2RWWE77PA7JNNIPWUBQYX44LDHDE6EBRFEPLJUOMBNLT4ATQ3SA7UGEQ",
  "metadata": {
    "rp": "algorand.co"
  }
}
```

Represents the following box Key Value pairs:

| name          | value                                                      |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| o_alice       | APZK5I5UAURBDSGFBEHYK3B235CDGYGXG6BAGC34ZHGDPQOJTBM5OSG6IE |
| o_bob         | BX2RWWE77PA7JNNIPWUBQYX44LDHDE6EBRFEPLJUOMBNLT4ATQ3SA7UGEQ |
| o_metadata.rp | algorand.co                                                |


### Blob/File

Assuming the blob is greater than the state storage, 
chunking is required and can be represented in an object

```json
{
  "index": 2,
  "mime": "text/plain",
  "blobs": [
    "...",
    "..."
  ]
}
```

Would produce the following keys

| name      | value      |
|-----------|------------|
| o_index   | 1          |
| o_mime    | text/plain |
| o_blob[0] | ...        |
| o_blob[1] | ...        |



## Backwards Compatibility

All backwards compatibility must be done with an Adapter.
