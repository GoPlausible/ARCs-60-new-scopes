## Abstract

The goal of this ARC is to clearly define the process for running for an xGov Council seat.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt">RFC-2119</a>.

### How to apply

In order to submit a proposal, a proposer needs to create a pull request on the following repository: <a href="https://github.com/algorandfoundation/xGov">xGov Council</a>.

Candidates must explain why they are applying to become an xGov Council member, their motivation for participating in the review process, and how their involvement can contribute to the Algorand ecosystem.

- Follow the [template provided](../assets/arc-0083/TemplateForm.md) and fill all the sections.
- Follow the <a href="https://github.com/algorandfoundation/xGov/blob/main/README.md">Rules</a> of the xGov Council Repository.

## Rationale

The xGov Council is a fundamental component of the xGov Program, tasked with reviewing proposals.
A structured, transparent application process ensures that only qualified and committed individuals are elected to the Council.

## Security Considerations

None
